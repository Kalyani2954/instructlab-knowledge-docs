# coachella_2023

The 2022 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival took place across two weekends: April 15 to 17 and April 22 to 24 at the Empire Polo Club, Indio, California, United States. The three headlining acts were Harry Styles, Billie Eilish and Swedish House Mafia with the Weeknd.
The 2022 edition of Coachella was the first to be held since 2019 after the cancellation of two previous editions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.


## Background

The 2020 festival line-up was announced on January 2, 2020, with headliners Rage Against the Machine, Travis Scott and Frank Ocean. The festival was originally set to be held on April 10–12 and 17–19, 2020, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was rescheduled to October 2020. Ultimately, the 2020 plan for the festival was scrapped and the organizer announced the replacement dates in April 2021. But, on January 29, 2021, public health officer for Riverside County, California, Dr. Cameron Kaiser announced that the festival was cancelled as he signed a public health order due to the COVID-19 related concerns.
For the 2022 festival, Rage Against the Machine and Travis Scott were originally featured as headliners, carrying over from the cancelled events. Following the Astroworld Festival crowd crush in November 2021, Scott was removed as a headliner per request of a petition to remove him. Rage Against the Machine were also revealed to not be performing following the full lineup announcement in January 2022. Meanwhile, Frank Ocean was instead confirmed to headline the 2023 edition.
A new lineup, featuring initial headliners Harry Styles, Billie Eilish, and Kanye West under the moniker "Ye" was announced on January 12, 2022. On April 4, 2022, it was announced that Ye dropped out as a headliner and was replaced by a collaboration between Swedish House Mafia and The Weeknd. Swedish House Mafia was originally supposed to fill in the "Returning to the Desert" slot. Many names had been rumored to fill in the headliner slot, including Justin Bieber, Travis Scott, Silk Sonic (featuring Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak) and Tyler, the Creator.
88rising made history as the first record label to showcase their roster at the festival. During the first weekend, Korean girl group 2NE1 reunited and gave their first performance since 2015. American hip-hop group Brockhampton announced that they would be disbanding and go on "indefinite hiatus", marking their Coachella appearance as their final performance.
